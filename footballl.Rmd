Let A nd B are two teams. Last 5 matches for A is ={ W,W,W,W,L}.
so robability of win is $P(W)=\frac{4}{5}$. The last 5 matches for B is ={ W,L,L,W,W}. So the win probability is $P(W)=\frac{3}{5}$.\
Now A nd B takes each other 25 times and among them A wins 12 and B wins 11 times. So the prior win probability for A is $P_0(W)=\frac{12}{25}$ and B is $P_0(W)=\frac{11}{25}$. So now if A and B takes each other then the probability that A will win is ,

$P(WIN) = prior * latest $

$$
P_A{W}=\frac{4}{5} * \frac{12}{25} \\
= .384
$$

and win probability for B is ,
$$
P_A{W}=\frac{3}{5} * \frac{1}{25} \\
= .264
$$

now standarized the probability that A and B will win the game ,

\begin{align*}
 P(A) = \frac{.384}{.384+.264}\\
=.6\\
P(B)= \frac{..264}{.384+.264}\\
=.4
\end{align*}
So the probability that A will win is 60% and  \
B will win  is 40%.
